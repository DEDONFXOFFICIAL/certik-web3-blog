> If your money ever got rugged in crypto…  
> If you ever clicked a shady airdrop link and your wallet said “bye”...  
> If you ever screamed *“Who audited this nonsense?!”*

There’s one name that should come to your mind: **CertiK**.

Let’s talk about them. 👇🏽

---

![Founded by Yale & Columbia professors](./2.jpg)

**Founded in 2018** by real professors from Yale and Columbia (not Twitter Uni graduates), CertiK had one job:  
**Make sure your favorite blockchain project doesn’t go boom.**  
Not with vibes. With real tech. And AI. And brain. 🧠

---

![What CertiK really does](./3.jpg)

Here’s what CertiK *really* does (in plain English):

- 🛠 Reads smart contracts like bedtime stories
- 🐛 Catches bugs before hackers do
- 📊 Rates projects on how likely they are to mess up
- ✅ Helps projects look legit — so *you* don’t lose money

Basically, they’re the Web3 version of **FBI + antivirus + therapy**.

---

![CertiK's tools explained](./4.jpg)

Let’s break their tools down like school subjects:

- 🔎 **Smart Contract Audits** = They check if your code is trash or treasure.  
- ⚙️ **Skynet** = A robot that watches Web3 projects 24/7. Like your mama watching who you follow.  
- 💼 **SkyInsights** = For anti-money laundering. Because crypto isn’t lawless (in theory).  
- 👨🏽‍🏫 **DeepSEA** = A safe compiler. Like Google Translate, but for nerds.  
- 💸 **CertiK Ventures** = They fund secure ideas — not bathroom-born meme coins.  
- 🧙🏽‍♂️ **Security Oracle** = Real-time risk ratings. Think crypto horoscope… but accurate.

---

![CertiK’s audit history](./5.jpg)

They’ve audited **4,900+** projects.  
Including heavyweights like:

- Ripple  
- Polygon  
- BNB Chain  

Basically, your favorite token knows CertiK better than it knows liquidity.

---

![Massive impact stats](./6.jpg)

Now here’s a crazy stat:

**70,000+ vulnerabilities** found in blockchain projects.  
That’s like finding 70,000 holes in the Titanic *before* it hits the iceberg.

---

![Protection value](./7.jpg)

CertiK has protected **$380+ BILLION** worth of digital assets.  

That’s enough money to buy:

- All the blue checks on X  
- All your exes’ apologies  
- A country (or two)

---

![Not just protection](./8.jpg)

CertiK didn’t stop at “protection.”  
They also:

- Got shout-outs from Samsung and Apple  
- Snitched on bugs in **iOS 17**  
- Saved **TON** and **SEI** from launch-time meltdowns  
- Found bugs in **XRP Ledger’s XLS-30d**

They’re the reason some blockchains didn’t catch fire on launch day. 🔥

---

![CertiK's clout](./9.jpg)

CertiK is not just code. They’re also **clout**:

- Raised **$296 million**  
- Valued at **$2 billion**  
- Backed by: Sequoia, Coinbase Ventures, Goldman Sachs, etc.

They’re not flexing. They’re funded. 💼💸

---

![CEO influence](./10.jpg)

Their CEO **Ronghui Gu** isn’t just chilling in a lab coat.  
He advises:

- The **Monetary Authority of Singapore**  
- **Hong Kong’s Web3 Task Force**

From classroom to crypto policymaker. **Respect.**

---

![2025 chaos](./11.jpg)

**2024–2025 was chaos for crypto**, but CertiK stayed locked in:

- 🔥 $302M lost in May 2025 alone  
- 🚨 4,484% spike in code-related losses  
- 🧠 Focused on **user security**: phishing & wallet protection now top threats

They’re shifting from “fix the code” to **“save the people.”**

---

![Node ops](./12.jpg)

They’re also deep into **node operations** now.  
You’ll find CertiK nodes on chains like **Qubic** — helping decentralize the future.

---

![Hacker school](./13.jpg)

They even run **hacker bootcamps** via hackathons and mentorships.

Imagine being trained by the team that saved **Apple’s kernel** and protected **billions**.

---

![Recent partnerships](./14.jpg)

CertiK recently partnered with:

- 🤖 **ChainGPT** (AI-powered token scanning)  
- 🛠 **SolvexNetwork** (secure Web3 dev stack)

When a project says *“Audited by CertiK”*,  
It’s not hype — it’s like getting your car checked by **NASA** before a road trip.

---

![Scammers evolve](./15.jpg)

But wait… the **bad guys evolved**.

**2024 was the year of phishing and fake friends.**  
Over **$1 BILLION** lost from social engineering.

CertiK’s answer?

- 🛡 Real-time monitoring  
- 👛 Wallet protection  
- 📚 Education

Because sometimes the danger isn’t in the code — it’s in the DMs.

---

![Security reports shift](./16.jpg)

CertiK reports now focus more on **human error** than just code flaws.

Their new motto could be:  
> “We can secure your code, but **please**, stop clicking shady links.”
